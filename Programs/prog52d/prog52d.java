 * Program: Prog152a
 * @Version: 1.0
 * @Author: Nicholas Rudd
 * Compiler/Platform: Java 1.8/ Windows 7 SP1 64bit
 * Desciption: This program runs 9669 times, calculates the sum of all the multiples between 3-9669 and then displays the total.

 * What I Learned: How to keep a running total when using a loop
 * Difficulties: Figuring out that the variable must be started before the loop, adds the variable in the loop, and then prints it out after the loop
